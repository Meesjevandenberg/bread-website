        <p>Congratulations You are a baguette!<br>
        Baguettes are the most basic of bitches. They tend to be kind and caring, but not creative and also very predictable. 
        To be a baguette is to be “normal”. A lot of people fall in to this category, so don’t fear. 
        There are still some of you that are not so boring as to not be able to hold a conversation too long. 
        There are genuinely some amongst your group that can actually be pretty interesting, 
        but you should not get your hopes up too high, because these are only rare occurrences. </p>
